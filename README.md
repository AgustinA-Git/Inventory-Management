# ABC XYZ Inventory-Management
Inventory Optimization with ABC-XYZ Analysis for 40 SKUs

This project applies ABC-XYZ analysis to a dataset of 40 SKUs to intelligently optimize inventory levels, reduce stockouts, and lower holding costs. Using the ABC classification, we rank items by revenue contribution (Pareto 80/20 rule), while the XYZ classification assesses demand predictability via the coefficient of variation (CV). Combined, this framework segments SKUs into 9 actionable categories (e.g., AX, BY, CZ), each with tailored stocking policies.

Key features:

- ABC analysis: Classifies SKUs based on total revenue impact

- XYZ analysis: Measures demand volatility using CV (σ/μ)

- Service level mapping: Assigns safety stock targets using Z-scores

- Policy simulation: Models different replenishment strategies by class

- KPI tracking: Evaluates improvements in stockout rate, inventory turnover, and total cost

Ideal for supply chain analysts, operations researchers, and inventory managers looking to apply structured logic to complex SKU portfolios.

Customize the provided Excel template or integrate the logic into Python, SQL, or BI dashboards for real-time SKU control.
